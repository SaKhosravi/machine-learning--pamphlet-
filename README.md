# Machine Learning Pamphlet


###This is a machine learning pamphlet presented in 2021 at Sharif University.

Typically, people who learn machine learning fall into two categories:

  1-Those who know and use machine learning algorithms but do not know exactly how they work 

  2-Those who know the math behind each algorithm and they use them well.

If you want to learn machine learning more deeply, you have to take an academic course. Fortunately, I found a great academic course (in Persian) that is available for free. Since after watching an instructional video, it is necessary to review its points, I wrote down the booklet of each part (in Persian) of this course (with Light pen). In line with the goal of the course instructor (dear [Dr Rahban's](http://sharif.ir/~rohban/)), I am publishing these notes. So this repository is notes from [machine learning course](https://www.aparat.com/v/bWr3A?playlist=954603) presented at Sharif University of Technology in 2021 (in Persian).

Each machine learning algorithm has a story and Dr Rahban is someone who, in addition to the mathematics behind each algorithm, tells you the story of that algorithm. This is a feature that sets this course apart from other academic courses.



This course consists of two parts:

The first section deals with the basic concepts required for machine learning And in the second part some important machine learning methods are explained.


This course has a [Quera page](https://quera.org/course/7772/note/46210) and the [syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19zYwnmGbBs8Dupdvsw_owwUB7b1NEeuHGRdhYUmdx0Y/edit#), are available from the link.
